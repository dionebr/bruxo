# Performance Benchmarks

> This section is a placeholder for future content as outlined in the project [Roadmap](../project/ROADMAP.md).

This document will provide detailed performance benchmarks for the Bruxo platform, comparing it against other well-known security tools.

## Scanner Performance (RPS)

- **Test Environment**: (e.g., AWS c5.large, 1Gbps network)
- **Target**: (e.g., DVWA running on a separate instance)
- **Wordlist**: (e.g., `common.txt` from SecLists)

| Tool | Average Requests/Second (RPS) | Memory Usage (MB) |
|---|---|---|
| Bruxo | (TBD) | (TBD) |
| Dirb | (TBD) | (TBD) |
| Gobuster | (TBD) | (TBD) |
| FFUF | (TBD) | (TBD) |

## C2 Agent Performance

- **Metric**: Agent check-in latency.
- **Metric**: CPU and Memory footprint on target (Windows & Linux).
- **Metric**: File transfer speed (Upload/Download).
