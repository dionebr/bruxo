# üßô Bruxo - High-Performance Web Directory Scanner

**Bruxo** is a command-line web directory scanner (fuzzer) written in Go and optimized for extreme speed. It combines a high-concurrency request engine with a clean user interface and interactive reports to provide a professional pentesting experience.

The project was focused on surpassing the benchmarks of established tools, utilizing the `fasthttp` library to minimize memory allocation and maximize requests per second.

## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚ö° **Extreme Performance**: Built with `fasthttp` to achieve hundreds of requests per second, optimized for low latency and minimal memory consumption.
- üìä **Interactive HTML Report**: Generates a modern dashboard with a doughnut chart (using Chart.js) that summarizes the distribution of found status codes.
- ü§ñ **AI Analysis (Optional)**: Integrate with the Groq API (using the Llama 3.1 model) to get security insights for each found result. Just set up your API key.
- üé® **Professional CLI Interface**:
    - A presentation banner with the project's visual identity.
    - A clear and aligned configuration panel.
    - A real-time progress bar with stats (RPS, Completed, Found).
    - A formatted summary table for easy reading.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Filtering and Options**:
    - **Add Extensions (`-x`)**: Add extensions like `.php`, `.html` to each word from the wordlist.
    - **Exclusion Filter (`-fx`)**: Ignore paths containing common keywords (e.g., `css`, `js`, `png`).
    - **Hidden Content Detection (`-hidden`)**: Finds pages that return the same status code as the "not found" page but with different content.

Make sure you have Go installed. To compile Bruxo, run:

```bash
go build -o bruxo bruxo.go
```

### 2. AI Analysis (Optional)

To use the AI analysis feature, you need an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys). Export the key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### 3. Running a Scan

Execute the compiled program with your desired parameters.

**Simple Example:**
```bash
./bruxo -u http://example.com -w /path/to/your/wordlist.txt
```

**Advanced Example (more threads, extensions, and an HTML report):**
```bash
